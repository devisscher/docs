You might want to automate your Now deployments. Here is how you can achieve this by using Git and Travis. Every time you push or merge to the master branch a new build and deployment is initiated in Travis CI.

1. You need to get a [token](https://zeit.co/account/tokens) from Zeit, take note of it. 
2. Create a .travis.yml file in the root of your project.
3. Generate a secure variable for your Zeit token by running the following command with the token you obtained from your Zeit account. (You need to install [The Travis Client](https://github.com/travis-ci/travis.rb#installation)): ${<TerminalInput>travis encrypt -r username/repo NOW_TOKEN=xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx --add</TerminalInput>} 
4. Now open your .travis.yml file and add the following:
${<Code>{`
language: node_js
node_js:
- "node"
cache: npm
script: npm run deploy
after_script: now alias -t $NOW_TOKEN
env:
global:
    secure: <this is your encrypted NOW token. It was added when you ran travis encrypt>
`}
</Code>}

5. Open your package.json file and add the following information, tailored to your site information. This is used to run the alias command and point your domain to the correct deployment (You could also put this in a [now.json](
    https://zeit.co/blog/now-json) file): 

${<Code>{`
{
    ...
    "now": {
        "name": "example",
        "alias": "example.com
        }
    ...
}`}</Code>}

6. Also add the following 2 scripts to the script property in your package.json file. These are used in your Travis config. The first is to deploy and the second is used to alias your latest deploy: 

${
<Code>{`
{
    ...
    "scripts": {
    ...
        "deploy": "now -e NODE_ENV=production --token $NOW_TOKEN --npm",
        "alias": "now alias --token=$NOW_TOKEN"
        }
    }
}`}
</Code>
}

7. Test it out by committing your code to Github. Check out your travis-ci.org build feed.
